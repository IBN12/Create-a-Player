My Creative Project 1: Create a Player

C++

Assignment:

This is a creative project using classes and the OOD (object-oriented design) methodology. 
This means you will have collection of interacting objects. 
Your classes will have member data such as member variables and member functions.

You will create a game that builds a custom character. The player should be able to give the character a first and last name. 

The player should be able to choose from a list of three weapons, a list of three types of clothing or gear, 
and another list of three items that are arranged for the character. The player should only be able to choose 1 item form each list. 
This list of choosing equipment should be a menu where you can enter, choose over again, and leave the menu. Each item should have its own stats.  

Note: I will add more information about this project soon to explain it.
